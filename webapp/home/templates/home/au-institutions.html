  <p>
    Galaxy Australia provides advanced features and extended quotas to publicly funded Australian researchers, as described in our
    <a href="#feature-catalogue">Feature Catalogue</a>.
    Access to these features and quotas is available to account holders registered using an email address from one of the Australian Research Institutions recognised as listed in the table below.

    This table is based on the NHMRC list of
    <a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/funding/manage-your-funding/nhmrcs-administering-institutions">Approved Administering Institutions</a>.
    We acknowledge that this list may not be exhaustive. Please
