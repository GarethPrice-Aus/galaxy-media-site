      Dear {{ form.cleaned_data.name }},
    </p>

    <p>
      A user has requested access to {{ form.RESOURCE_NAME }} on Galaxy Australia with your
      email address ({{ form.cleaned_data.email }}).
      <b>Unfortunately we cannot process this request</b>,
      because we could not find a Galaxy Australia account registered to this
      email address.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you would still like to access {{ form.RESOURCE_NAME }} on Galaxy Australia, please
      do one of the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Open a Galaxy Australia account with this email address and re-submit your request
      </li>
      <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        - OR -
      </li>
      <li>
        Re-submit the access request form with an institutional email address
        that is registered to a Galaxy Australia account
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If this was not you, please disregard this email and no action will be
      taken.
