    <h3>Access to AlphaFold could not be granted</h3>

    <p>
      Dear {{ form.cleaned_data.name }},
    </p>

    <p>
      A user has requested access to AlphaFold on Galaxy Australia with your
      email address ({{ form.cleaned_data.email }}).
      <b>Unfortunately we cannot process this request</b>,
      because we did not find a Galaxy Australia account registered to this
      email address.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you would still like to access AlphaFold on Galaxy, please do one of
      the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Open a Galaxy AU account with this email address
      </li>
      <li>
        Re-submit the access request form with an institutional email address
        that is registered to a Galaxy AU account
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Galaxy AU receives additional funding dedicated to Australian researchers.
      By associating yourself with an Australian institution in Galaxy AU,
      you will gain access to resources such as additional storage, compute and
      special tools like AlphaFold.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this was not you, please disregard this email and no action will be
      taken.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regards,
      <br>
